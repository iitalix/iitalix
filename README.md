Software Developer and seasoned IT professional interested in ML/AI and cloud technologies.

Currently strengthening my Python/JavaScript skills while learning TensorFlow, GraphQL, and
pursuing an AWS certification. Playing with my cats and binging dating reality-tv shows in
my spare time.

Gamer. 👾 Foodie. 🍜 Music Lover. 🎶

Checkout a couple of my projects!

  [Cybervana](https://cybervana.onrender.com) is an e-commerce site
  themed off my favorite video game "Cyberpunk 2077."
  
  [Shutterscape](https://shutterscape.onrender.com) (group project) is
  a photo-sharing site similar to Flickr, which allows you to share and
  comment on photos, create albums, and mark your Favorites.

I also livestream video games, but I've been super busy!
