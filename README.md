I'm an experienced I.T. professional looking to pivot into
a new role as a Software Developer. I am passionate about
technology and interested in designing and creating.

Let's build something fun together!

Here's a couple of my projects:

  [Cybervana](https://cybervana.onrender.com) is an e-commerce site
  themed off my favorite video game "Cyberpunk 2077."
  
  [Shutterscape](https://shutterscape.onrender.com) (group project) is
  a photo-sharing site similar to Flickr, which allows you to share and
  comment on photos, create albums, and mark your Favorites.

When I'm not learning code, I'm creating content playing video games.
